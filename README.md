# SQLite React Todo App

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

     yarn 

Run the frontend (do this in one terminal window)

     yarn run start-backend

Run the backend (do this in another terminal window)

    yarn run start-backend

**(Optionally, you can use npm for this â€” just switch into the `frontend/backend` folders and `npm run start` from there.)**

## Notes

  * The prepopulated Todos are a couple days into the future.
